1. Creating a Child Theme from Scratch
=====================================================================================================
=====================================================================================================
17m 2s

What is a WordPress child theme and when should you use it?
2m 38s
So by splitting your modifications into a child theme, you protect your own modifications while using the original 
theme and getting all the upgrades. It's a simple choice; if you want to use a theme and you want to make any change, 
even if it's a really small one, always use a child theme. Now let's get started.

Picking a parent theme
3m 55s
Free vs Premium Pay themes discussed.
However, there's a caveat to that. In premium themes you'll often find proprietary code, meaning instead of using core WordPress 
functionality, the developer may have created new functionality specifically for that theme or for that foundry, so that those 
functions only work as long as you use their themes, and if you ever move away from their themes, you'll lose some of your content. 
Free themes are generally sparse on features, meaning you get core functionality from WordPress and not much else.

Free themes in general cannot be expected to be future proof, meaning you can't expect them to be updated and you can't expect them 
to start including new features that come out with WordPress, at least not immediately. That is unless you install a theme that comes 
directly from WordPress itself.

So one of the default themes for instance will always be up-to-date and will always have all the new features built in. 
On the other hand, premium themes may have extra caveats that you're not aware of. For example, I've seen theme foundries 
that actually charge you extra if you want to make a child theme based on one of their premium themes. So that's something 
you have to look up before you buy a theme from a premium theme foundry. Although there are thousands of free and premium 
WordPress themes out there to choose from, chances are you're actually better off just using one of the default themes that 
comes with WordPress when you're creating a child theme.

The reason for that is the default themes have all the latest features, they're all built properly, they're future proof, 
and they're always easy to work with, because they have great documentation. In this course, we'll be working with the Twenty 
Twelve theme, which was released in the fall of 2012. This theme is simple to use, it has all the core features we need, and 
it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand and easy to build child themes from. 



Making sure you have the Twenty Twelve parent theme
1m 50s

Creating and activating a basic child theme
4m 20s
In the content themes folder create a subfolder  eg childoftwentytwelve
Now create a file style.css from notepad++ and save as cascading stylesheet

Now all we need it put something like this in it
/*
Theme Name: Child of Twenty Twelve
Theme URI: ????
Description: Cool child theme based on Twenty Twelve
Author: Rick MacLean
Version: 0.0.1 
Template: twentytwelve
*/

Now you'll also notice this looks terrible and that's because my child theme currently has no stylesheet, so what you're seeing is only the 
content on the page with no style. That's the next step to add style back into the child theme.

Then goto Themes and we see that theme available as a child theme which I can activate. 


Importing parent theme styles
4m 19s
When you make a child theme, you start off with a theme that displays all the content without any style. That's because your child theme 
stylesheet is currently empty. If you're going to build a new layout with completely custom styles this is great because you can start 
from scratch, but in most cases, you want to import the existing styles from the parent theme and then work based on those styles. 

There are two ways of doing this (I'll show you my recommendation.)

The two methods are overwriting versus overriding, and though they sound almost the same, they're very different when you actually do them.

overwriting: you copy out all the code from the stylesheet, and you paste all that code into your child theme stylesheet. That way you have 
     full micromanaging control over every little piece of style code in your theme, and you never have a situation where one piece of 
	 code overrides another piece of code.
	 
	 It means that you can ignore anything that's happening in the parent theme, and you can write your own style code, and everything will be 
	 fine. That means no surprises, but it also means that if an update comes out for the parent theme, and that update includes new content, 
	 that new content will not be styled and you'll have to write styles for it. 
	 
overriding: you simply reference the parent styles, and then you just add the styles you want to change in your child theme styles.css file.
     This means you have control over everything you want to control, and you leave everything else to the parent theme. It also means that any 
	 future styles that are included in an update will also be included in your child theme, and it means that in very rare cases some of those 
	 future styles may mess with what you've already created. But the most important thing about overriding is that you will always get all the 
	 updates and it's a lot less work. So I recommend, unless you're changing everything, you should always use the overriding method.
	 
open style.css
  @import url('../twentytwelve/stle.css')	

Understanding this technique of importing the styles from the parent stylesheet into the child theme stylesheet without actually copying it, 
and then overriding those existing styles is very important when you work with the child themes, because then you only have to focus on changing 
the things that you want to change on the website and you can leave everything else alone.

2. Modifying and Adding Styles
=====================================================================================================
=====================================================================================================
16m 2s

Using the developer tools
3m 53s
When you work with child themes, or any other theme for that matter, one of the first things people want to do when they install a WordPress 
site and start working with the theme is make changes to the stylesheet, and this is where an important tool in this browser comes in.

Most modern browsers have web developer tools built-in to make it easy for you to connect to HTML and the CSS together, and 
also experiment with it.

In Chrome, the web developer tools can be accessed in several different ways. You can go up to the menu here on the far right corner, and 
select Tools > Developer tools. 

You can also just hit 
Ctrl+Shift+I 
in your browser, this will also open the web developer tools, 

or if you want to target a specific element,  all I have to do is 
right-click on it, 
select Inspect element and the web developer tools will open directly to that element. 

The web developer tools are actually advanced applications that let you interact with the live code on the web and make changes to it and 
experiment with it to find out how it works.

So basically the browser and the web developer tools gives me an environment where I can experiment with my code and figure out how 
things fit together and how they work, and then once I have a code I want and it looks the way I want it to, I can copy it out and 
save it and make it permanent.






Modifying existing styles
4m 24s
CSS or cascading style sheets work on the simple principle of a cascade. The first styles that are listed have less importance than the last 
ones, meaning the ones that are the furthest down in the stylesheet matter the most. 

*****
eg we will change the image round corners
goto developer tools 
select an image 
see styles on right box 
experiment to find the right thing 
copy the style and paste in my childTheme
and make the changes I want


Adding space between paragraphs
4m 7s
you should do is change the margins around each paragraph to change the height. So if I want to change the space 
underneath each of the paragraphs what I need to do is make a small change to the style that affects the paragraphs. 





Changing font family styles
3m 38s
One of the many factors that play into putting forward a consistent presence on the web is the use of fonts. In the past, 
web fonts were fairly restricted. But today thanks to modern browser technology, you have far greater options where fonts 
are concerned. The Twenty Twelve theme ships with a custom font hosted by Google Web fonts. Later in the course, we will look 
at how you can swap out this Google font for different Google web font, but for now, let's take a look at how you can change the 
style sheet in your child theme to use a standard font instead of the one that ships.

inspect element
computed style???? computed
see this 
  font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;   note Open Sans and has the fallbacks if the first was not there.

To find the original style that kicks in here, instead of using the technique I showed you earlier, I'm simply going to go into 
the Computed Styles and click on this link that points to the original style in the style-sheet. see by opening font-family
You see body.custom-font-enabled and then you have the font family: Open Sans, Helvetica, Arial, Sans Serif. Directly 
above it, you'll notice that the body style also has a font family defined.

see this
body.custom-font-enabled {
	font-family: "Open Sans", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
So I'll copy that's style out, go in to my child theme, and because this is a body style it should be high up in the hierarchy. 
So I'm going to paste that in directly under the import call. 

So I'm going to swap out all this code with Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, Serif. When I save the style-sheet now, and 
reload the web page in my browser, you will see that all the fonts on the entire page have been changed to Georgia because 
that's now the main font family. Now it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily work the exact same way on all themes. 

Many themes have very specific fonts assigned to different elements, and you may find that there's several different places 
where the font is defined.

In which case, you have to go in and find all the places where the font is defined in the original style-sheet and then 
overwrite it piece by piece, but in a well-written theme the font is defined once at the very top and you can simply overwrite it the 
way we did just know, by just typing in a new font family. 

Choosing the right font family for your site is important, and no matter what people say, there is no such thing as a right or wrong font.
The font that fits with your message and communicates it well is the right font for your website.

3. Modifying and Adding Templates
=====================================================================================================
=====================================================================================================31m 47s
Understanding the WordPress template hierarchy
3m 12s
Before we dive deeper into the world of WordPress themes, it's important that you have an understanding of how WordPress 
operates and how the different pages of your website are created. WordPress is a web application that interacts with a 
database. That means the constant you enter when you create a new post or a new page doesn't live in the website itself. 
The content lives in a database and it's only displayed using 

At any one time, when there's a person asking for SPECIFIC CONTENT from the database, by clicking a link inside your site, 
the DATABASE AND THE BROWSER INTERACT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TYPE OF CONTENT THIS is and then use the appropriate template 
file to display that content. 


templates *********

when the visitor asks for that content. 

********A theme is a collection of templates WordPress uses to display the database content. *********

For instance, if you were to look at an 
index page, like the front of a blog, 
you would usually see a header created by the header.php template, 
you would see the content created by index.php, 
you would see a sidebar created by sidebar.php 
and the footer created by footer.php. 

But if you were to look at a single page, 
we would still see the same header, 
the same sidebar and the 
same footer 
but the content would be created by a single.php instead. 

So how do you know which of these template files kick-in at what point? That's where the WordPress template hierarchy comes in.

eg
Let's say you're accessing an archive page, 
         the category archive, you go in here, it says what is the page, it's an Archive Page and it's Category Archive.
		 
		 Okay, in that case, we're going to use the category.php template, right here, 
		            or if we are more specific about our call, 
					we can also use the category ID template 
					or even the category slug template. 
					If none of these files exit, we fall back to archive.php and then everything gets displayed. 
					
The same goes if you're looking at a single post. 
You ask, what kind of page is it? 
		It's a Singular Page, it's a Single Post Page and this is a Blog Post which means we'll use single post.php, 
		and if single post.php doesn't exist, we're going to use single.php instead 
		and if none of these template files exit, we fall back to index.php.
		


So when you're editing template files in WordPress themes, what you have to think about is what type of content this is 
and then edit the appropriate template file for that type of content. This may seem confusing at first but once just 
start working with it you will quickly see that there's a very clear system here and that by knowing what template file 
to edit you'll be able to control every aspect of what comes out the other end when people access your WordPress site.





Modifying existing templates
2m 33s
When you modify or add to an existing template file in a child theme, you replace the original template file.

eg. Change the single.php template so need to copy it to my child theme
copy from C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\twentytwelve\single.php




Moving the header image
4m 29s
eg  Appearance : Header : upload header
now we wnat to move it's location. We just cut and paste it above the site name and description. BUT I now need to make more space 
after the image.
NOTE class="header-image"
so we need a css entry for this class.
create a style called
.header-image {
	margin-bottom: 24px;    <--note any spaces after 24 means it does not work
}

Now let's get rid of the site title and tag line in appearance uncheck that.
I added text the a header image so that my site name is showing without the site title and tag line showing.







Adding Related Posts feature to posts
6m 26s
Here we add "Yet Another Related Posts Plugin" YARPP and a function 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/

adds a list of related posts. It reads your posts and suggests related ones. 
check settings  then SAVE now see where it shows up in my posts.
NOW uncheck Automatically display related content from YARPP Basic on:...then see MORE question mark and can use relates_posts() function to have it show up in a different place

now open my single.php and make the changes.  
find nav-single and remove it
<nav class="nav-single">
					<h3 class="assistive-text"><?php _e( 'Post navigation', 'twentytwelve' ); ?></h3>
					<span class="nav-previous"><?php previous_post_link( '%link', '<span class="meta-nav">' . _x( '&larr;', 'Previous post link', 'twentytwelve' ) . '</span> %title' ); ?></span>
					<span class="nav-next"><?php next_post_link( '%link', '%title <span class="meta-nav">' . _x( '&rarr;', 'Next post link', 'twentytwelve' ) . '</span>' ); ?></span>
				</nav><!-- .nav-single -->
insert
<?php
related_posts();
?>

What if we deactivate the plugin????
Therefore need to do this 
   if (function_exists()
   
And that if something disastrous happens when you install the new function, all you have to do is remove the template file 
from your child theme and everything goes back to normal again.

If you use plugins in your site, I guarantee you'll come across ones that require you to add functions or other elements 
to your template files. Using a child theme and wrapping these plugin functions and conditional function_exists tags 
ensures that you get the full use out of your plugin, that if the plugin breaks or gets deactivated, or uninstalled, 
it doesn't break your site.




Creating custom page templates
5m 43s
POSTS vs PAGES types of content 

2012 has different types of pages 
Default Template
Front Page Template 
Full-width Page Template with No Sidebar.

see page attributes for templates to choose which one. Each of the above ones can had settings changed on them for what displays. 

CREATE OWN PAGE TEMPLATES
You can create your own page templates to produce specific results on specific pages. I use this 
technique quite often, because not all pages should be displayed the same way.

look under theme/page-templates   see front-page.php and full-width.php 

now for standard template copy  C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\twentytwelve\page.php and rename it 
no-title-page.php 

tell Wordpress this is a custom template by changing the comment.
/*
Template Name: No title page template
 */
NOW Wordpress will show that as an option for pages. Holy cow what black box magic!



Now see the following 
<?php get_template_part( 'content', 'page' ); ?>   this is a reference to content-page.php 
so I can replace this with the lines in that file and edit it.
NOW delete this
<header class="entry-header">
								<?php if ( ! is_page_template( 'page-templates/front-page.php' ) ) : ?>
								<?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>
								<?php endif; ?>
								<h1 class="entry-title"><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
							</header>

The custom page template is an often overlooked tool in the WordPress theme arsenal that allows you to create 
customized experiences for your visitors in a very simple way. The best way to get the most out of a custom 
page template is to simply start experimenting. And remember, there are no limits here. If the information 
exists, you can display it.





Using conditional statements for customized effects
5m 41s
Now I am going to show you a much cleaner and just as quick way of doing the same thing. as done in the last movie.

Rather than copying and pasting the code, I am going to use one of the many conditional tags built into WordPress, 
to test to see if were using a custom page template and then display the content accordingly.

if then statements.

set my custom page back to what it was before.
<?php get_template_part( 'content', 'page' ); ?>
and use 
codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags   for displaying things

eg Conditional tags are small functions built into WordPress that allow us to test for different scenarios, 
and then do things based on those tests. Basically you are saying things like if this is the homepage then 
do the following, if it's not, do something else.

SOOOO copy content-page.php to child theme and edit it. 
wrap it in 

<?php 
		if ( ! is_page_template('no-title-page.php') ) { ?>
		<header class="entry-header">
			<?php if ( ! is_page_template( 'page-templates/front-page.php' ) ) : ?>
			<?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>
			<?php endif; ?>
			<h1 class="entry-title"><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
		</header>
<?php } ?>

Using conditional tags, or even regular conditional if then statements in your child theme, you can turn on and 
off elements and functions at will to create highly customized behavior. I use conditional statements constantly 
in my sites, because they make the themes lean and clean, and make it easier to manage the template files. 

The rule of thumb here is this, if you want to show or hide something on a page or post and you're planning 
on making a new template, see if you can get the computer to test for a condition instead so you don't have 
to write out the entire new template.



Creating custom header, footer, and sidebar templates
3m 43s
The "custom front page template" has separate wigitized areas, or sidebars, than the regular page templates. 
 the widgets area  see it in the back end. 
 Main Sidebar, which is what appears on posts and regular pages, 
 and then you have this 
 First Front Page Widget Area 
 and 
 Second Front Page Widget Area, 
 
 These appear in the bottom of the "custom front page template"
 see the files: sidebar.php and sidebar-front.php
 
 Seeing the two files you can see 'sidebar-1' 'sidebar-2' 'sidebar-3'
 where do they come from???? see page.php and call to get_sidebar();  just like get_footer and get_header
 
NOTE: in front-page.php the call is this   get_sidebar('front')   which calls sidebar-front.php

PATTERN.
normal 
<?php get_header(); ?>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

to call header-custom.php    --> <?php get_header('custom'); ?>


eg REGULAR

header.php 

page.php calls
    get_header();                       sidebar.php 
	get_footer();
	get_sidebar();

footer.php

CUSTOM eg no-title-page.php

header-custom.php 

no-title-page.php calls
    get_header('custom');                                             sidebar.php 
	get_footer();   can do the same for sidebar and footer too
	get_sidebar();

footer.php


====
====
This allows you to add and subtract content in areas like the header, sidebar, footer, depending on what page, 
post, or index the visitor lands on, and that can in turn be used to give the visitor a more meaningful and 
informational experience when visiting your site.

4. Customizing the Index Pages
=====================================================================================================
=====================================================================================================
17m 5s
Understanding the different index pages and what they do
4m 6s
One of the key components of any WordPress site is the index pages. Simply put, an index page shows a list of 
posts from the site depending on what you're asking for. The most well-known of the index pages is the blog page, 
which displays all the posts of the site in reverse chorological order. Other index pages include category index 
and archive indexes. The index pages in a WordPress theme or child theme live in a hierarchy and kick in at different 
times. Understanding which index page template handles and displays what content will help you customize the look 
and feel of your site and also avoid a lot of frustration when things don't display the way you intended.

What happens when you display any page in WordPress is the database and the browser cooperate to 
figure out what template to use.

eg looking at a Category page 
Wordpress says what kind of page is this????
it is an Archive Page : Catergory Archive :  do we have a file called    category-slug.php??? 
														then do we have category-Number.php
														yes/no then do we have category.php then use it.
											       
Sooooo we have the following Archivefiles
archive.php 
author.php 
category.php 
tag.php


eg
index.php   see codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy
also see 
<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
				<?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?>
			<?php endwhile; ?>
			
this means get for each post 
content.php 
BUT also have content files for each of the main post formats, aside, image, link, and so on.
contant-aside.php 
content-image.php 
...
...etc

We even have one for page. If we look at content, you'll see that all that happens here inside the loop is we display the 
content for each post. We get the post thumbnail, we get the title, we get the comments link, and we get either an excerpt 
or the contents, depending on what type of archive this is. So as you can see, just like with the page templates, the 
index page templates work in collaboration with the content templates to display all the content.

So as you can see, just like with the page templates, the index page templates work in collaboration with the content 
templates to display all the content.

Understanding how the index pages work will help you come up with, and implement, new and exciting ways to display 
content. More importantly though, it'll help you troubleshoot potential problems when something doesn't display 
the way you intended, because now that you know how the template structure works, you can track down the correct 
template and make changes to that template when things aren't displaying correctly.




Adding author, date, and time information to the index loop
7m 15s
Once you start personalizing your child theme, you'll probably want to make changes to the index pages, as well as 
a single posts and pages. Working with the index templates require a bit more thinking on your end, but it's not 
any more complicated, and you can produce some pretty cool results with very little effort. 

He wants to move the Author etc to the top of the post vs the bottom 
See index.php 
which calls content.php so copy this to child theme 

THen move <footer class="entry-meta">
			<?php twentytwelve_entry_meta(); ?> up to before    <div class="comments-link">
BUT it has more than I want sooooo. find twentytwelve_entry_meta()   in functions.php
and copy $date and $author, then echo 'Published on: ' . $date . 'By: ' . $author


So all we have to do is copy out the entire section here from footer to end footer and paste it into content.php and 
you'll get the same results that I got. Here you've seen several different things: how the content.php template file 
interacts with multiple different other template files and uses functions from those files to display content; you've 
also seen how we can use existing code as building blocks to create new effects; and you've gotten a sneak peek at the 
functions.php file that we'll look at in more detail later.

But I want you to take away from this is any content you can see on the page you can always grab and put somewhere else 
in your template simply by copying wherever it comes from and placing it somewhere else.
